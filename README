CS 498 - Group 8 

PROJECT OVERVIEW : 

The project we are working on is a web app. It uses speech-to-text to take user inputs towards tailer-making a Resume.  

TO ACCESS THE PROJECT:
 
go to 128.163.232.240
Make sure this is in GOOGLE CHROME. 
You will be warned that the 'connection is not secure.' Please navigate to advanced settings, and continue to the site. 
This warning is present because we are using a self-signed certificate for HTTPS. 

TECHNOLOGIES REQUIRED:
-> Microphones and Speakers (Hardware)
-> Google Chrome

USER BASE:

Anyone who is looking for employment and plans to build a Resume. Future iterations may include different resumes available for 
different career pathways, such as entry-level applications vs. experienced applications. 



FEASIBILITY: 

Timeline expectations: 
    Iteration 1: We will have completed a basic speech to text bot using Python APIS. This bot will ask the user questions through
    the device's speaker and receive audio input, which is displayed at the end of the session. 
    
    Iteration 2: We will complete a basic web interface that works across all browser types. This will be tested and verified using Selenium. 
    The web app will allow the user to choose a resume template but will not yet incorporate the speech-to-text bot. 

    Iteration 3: We will integrate the python bot and the web interface. This will be the "bare bones" product and will allow the user to
    run a resume session, review, and download a resume through the website. 

    Final presentatino: We will refine any existing problems and add additional functionailities (different resume template options, career pathways, etc)

Team skills: 
    - Tej:  Python speech-to-text API
    - Evan: front-end web development 
    - Kyle: front-end web development and testing 
    - Eura: back-end web development, integration

Forseeable risks: 
    - Internet traffic, especially with an audio heavy application
    - Speech to text may not always be robust to different accents/sound quality
    - Integrating python application with web technologies will be difficult
